## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

The "Power BI HR Data Transformation and Advanced Visualization" project aims to showcase the capabilities of Power BI in transforming raw, messy HR data into a clean, organized format and then using it to create interactive and advanced reports and dashboards. The project focuses on taking data in CSV format, which is often unstructured and challenging to analyze, and demonstrates how Power Query can be used to clean and shape the data into a usable form. The transformed data is then loaded into Power BI, where it is utilized to build insightful HR reports and dashboards.

Key Objectives:

Data Transformation: Utilize Power Query in Power BI to clean, transform, and reshape raw HR data from a CSV file. Highlight various data cleaning techniques, such as handling missing values, renaming columns, and merging data.

Advanced Visualization: Leverage Power BI's visualization tools to create engaging and insightful reports and dashboards. Incorporate a variety of visual elements, including charts, graphs, tables, and interactive filters.

Interactive Dashboards: Develop interactive dashboards that allow users to explore HR metrics and trends dynamically. Enable users to filter data, drill down into specific details, and extract meaningful insights.

User-Friendly Analysis: Emphasize the user-friendly nature of the reports, making it easy for HR professionals and stakeholders to understand the data and draw conclusions without requiring advanced technical skills.
